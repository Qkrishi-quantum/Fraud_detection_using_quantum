# Fraud Detection using Quantum Machine Learning

## Overview

This GitHub repository contains two Jupyter notebooks that demonstrate the application of Quantum Machine Learning (QML) in fraud detection for credit card transactions and stock trading. The notebooks leverage the power of quantum computing to enhance the accuracy and efficiency of fraud detection algorithms.

## Contents

1. [Credit Card Fraud Detection](Credit_Card_Fraud_Detection.ipynb)
2. [Stock Fraud Detection](Stock_Fraud_Detection.ipynb)

## Credit Card Fraud Detection

The first notebook focuses on detecting fraudulent activities in credit card transactions using Quantum Machine Learning. It utilizes quantum algorithms to process and analyze the transaction data, providing a more robust and secure solution compared to classical methods.

### Dependencies

- [Qiskit](https://qiskit.org/)
- [NumPy](https://numpy.org/)
- [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/)
- [Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/)

### Instructions

1. Install the required dependencies using the following command:
   ```bash
   pip install qiskit numpy pandas matplotlib
   ```

2. Open and run the [Credit_Card_Fraud_Detection.ipynb](Credit_Card_Fraud_Detection.ipynb) notebook in a Jupyter environment.

3. Follow the instructions within the notebook to execute the quantum fraud detection algorithm on the provided credit card transaction dataset.

## Stock Fraud Detection

The second notebook addresses fraud detection in stock trading using Quantum Machine Learning. By employing quantum algorithms, the notebook enhances the detection capabilities for fraudulent stock activities, providing insights into potentially malicious trading behaviors.

### Dependencies
